# Attorney Online Client

this project uses QT 5.7

you will need to make a qt project then add these files to the project. Then, you need to add characters/ and background/ from a vanill ao installation

masterchat works 100%, favorites work and servers show online staus and clicking "connect" will bring up a prototype playing window(will not connect to the selected server yet)

MAKE SURE THE CODE BUILDS BEFORE PUSHING

here is a working windows build:
